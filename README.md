# advent_of_code_2022

If you are here just to look at some Rust code
notice that this is not the most efficient way of writing Rust code.

You can run the programs using `cargo run --bin day{day number} -- -1 < input_file`.
You can replace `-1` with `-2` if you wish to run the second part of the problem.

Hopefully, you will enjoy it, or not idk.
